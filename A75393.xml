            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

<pb facs="tcp:155980:3"/>from thence, and it is thought the Lord</hi> Fairfax <hi>will become Maſter of the field, and that it will be a good means to ſettle the peace of that County: for after the late victory obtained by the Lord</hi> Fairfax <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst the Earl of</hi> Newcaſtle <hi>neer Wake<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, the ſaid Earl came againſt Leeds to beſiege the Lord</hi> Fairfax <hi>with a great part of the forces which he had at York, the Lord</hi> Fairfax <hi>maintained not only the quarters which he had before, as Leeds, Halifax, and other places in thoſe parts, but forced the enemy to retreat, and inlar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged his quarters, by which means he met the enemy in the field, which the Malig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants boaſted he durſt not do, and ſo it pleaſed God to give unto him this victory alſo, which as though J doubt not but will be ratified by inſuing relations, yet for the preſent, becauſe J am the firſt that have
<pb facs="tcp:155980:3"/>written of this matter, and unwilling to write the leaſt untruth, wherby the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome might be miſ-informed, J ſhall omit many particulars touching the ſaid fight at Barnham, yet it is reported that the Lord</hi> Fairfax <hi>took at leaſt</hi> 2000. <hi>armes, and ſix pieces of Ordnance, and many of the priſoners taken are perſons of good quality, as Colonels, Captains, and at leaſt forty Colours, beſides many other Officers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This victory hath ſo diſhartned the reſt of the Popiſh army about Yorke, that ſome of the Frenchmen and others w<hi rend="sup">ch</hi> the Queen brought over with her, do wiſh themſelves again in their owne Countrey: and it is informed, that Sir <hi>William Fairfax</hi> is with a conſiderable number of men marched toward York, in which voyage there is no doubt (through Gods mercy) but he will
<pb facs="tcp:155980:4"/>finde good ſucceſſe; for except the County of Lancaſter, we have not the like experience of Gods goodneſs to the poore Proteſtants of England as in this County, for as in Lancaſhire, ſo in Yorkeſhire there was great ſtore of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſts, and malevolents, and certainly if the Kings army could have gained love in any place, it would have been in this county, which was the place where the army firſt gathered together againſt the Parliament, and yet at that time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore any act of hoſtillity againſt them, and the deſign was carried with as much ſecrecy and ſubtilty as poſsible could be, under a colour of defending the Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and liberty of the ſubject, it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed God to give the greateſt part of this county ſuch a diſcerning ſpirit that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding all the faire ſhewes and
